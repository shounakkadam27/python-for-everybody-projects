# Python for Everybody Specialization Projects
Hands-on Python mini-projects from the Python for Everybody course, demonstrating core programming concepts.

This repository contains selected assignments from the Python for Everybody Specialization (University of Michigan, Coursera).
The projects demonstrate core Python programming concepts applied to real-world tasks such as text parsing, data handling, web scraping, working with APIs, and databases.

# Repository Structure 
control-flow/       # 
strings-files/      # Text parsing & file handling
data-structures/    # Dictionaries, lists, tuples
web-scraping/       # HTML, XML, JSON parsing
capstone/           # Final projects (APIs, Geodata)

# Projects Included 
Strings & Files:
  -Word frequency counter in mbox-short.txt
  -Most common email sender
Data Structures:
  -Counting email domains using dictionaries
  -Using tuples to sort frequency counts
Web Scraping & APIs
  -HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
  -XML parsing (summing counts)
  -JSON API (extracting location data / plus codes)
Capstone
  -Geodata project (geoload.py, geodump.py) â€“ mapping locations from a dataset

# Usage
Each project folder contains:
Python script (.py)
Sample input data (.txt, .xml, .json)
README.md with problem description + usage example 

# Skills Demonstrated 
File handling (reading, writing, parsing text files)
Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
Web scraping (HTML, XML, JSON with BeautifulSoup & urllib)
Database operations with SQLite
API requests and handling JSON data
Writing reusable, well-documented Python scripts
